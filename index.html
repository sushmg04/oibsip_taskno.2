          <h2>Stephen Hawking</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Stephen William Hawking CH CBE FRS FRSA (8 January 1942 â€“ 14 March 2018) was an English theoretical 
                physicist, cosmologist, and author who, at the time of his death, was director of research at the Centre
                 for Theoretical Cosmology at the University of Cambridge. Between 1979 and 2009, he was the 
                 Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, widely viewed as one of the most 
                 prestigious academic posts in the world.
                Hawking was born in Oxford into a family of physicians. In October 1959, at the age of 17, he began his 
                university education at University College, Oxford, where he received a first-class BA degree in physics. 
                In October 1962, he began his graduate work at Trinity Hall at the University of Cambridge where, 
                in March 1966, he obtained his PhD degree in applied mathematics and theoretical physics, specialising
                 in general relativity and cosmology. In 1963, at age 21, Hawking was diagnosed with an early-onset 
                 slow-progressing form of motor neurone disease that gradually, over decades, paralysed him. 
                 After the loss of his speech, he communicated through a speech-generating device initially through 
                 use of a handheld switch, and eventually by using a single cheek muscle.
                Hawking's scientific works included a collaboration with Roger Penrose on gravitational singularity 
                theorems in the framework of general relativity, and the theoretical prediction that black holes emit 
                radiation, often called Hawking radiation. Initially, Hawking radiation was controversial. By the late 
                1970s and following the publication of further research, the discovery was widely accepted as a major 
                breakthrough in theoretical physics. Hawking was the first to set out a theory of cosmology explained 
                by a union of the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. He was a vigorous supporter of the 
                many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.
